This repository has a full data mining project report that uses the UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset (569 samples, 30 nuclear features) to guess whether a tumor is cancerous. It is built on four Jupyter notebooks and includes data cleaning and EDA (showing distributions, correlations, and outliers), feature engineering with standardization, regression modeling (Linear, Ridge, Lasso), high-performance classification (SVM achieving 98.25% accuracy, 98.61% F1, AUC 0.997; Decision Tree baseline), hyperparameter-tuned models, K-Means clustering (Silhouette 0.345, ARI 0.677) with PCA visualization, and association rule mining (Apriori-style on discretized features showing strong malignancy patterns, such as high worst concave points → malignant with lift ≈ 2.0). The final report has in-depth insights, clinical suggestions, and an ethical discussion on fairness, transparency, and reducing bias. This book is perfect for students, researchers, or doctors who are interested in healthcare analytics, machine learning that can be understood, and using diagnostic decision-support tools. With scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, run notebooks one after the other.
